## Overview

This is a Shopify theme that uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The theme includes various sections and templates for product pages, blog posts, and static pages. All Tailwind classes are prefixed with `tw-` to avoid conflicts with Shopify's default styling.

shopify theme dev --store the-dc-bureau.myshopify.com 

```npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/app-tailwind.css -o ./assets/app.css --watch```

All tailwind classes should be used with the prefix "tw-".
