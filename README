## Styling

To run tailwindcss, use the following in a separate terminal:

```npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/app-tailwind.css -o ./assets/app.css --watch```

All tailwind classes should be used with the prefix "tw-".

Note: the sections and snippets that are built with tailwind are the active sections and snippets.
