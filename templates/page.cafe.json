I fell in love with tan lines at a young age. I used to fight a lot. It's hard to walk away from ding dongs. I like beer a lot but sometimes I'm not good at them. I'm really good at cigarettes. I smoked 3 cigarettes during the New York Marathon. I have bad ADHD. I might have CTE but I won't know until I take a dirt nap in a mahogany pea coat. I've never shown my paintings by myself. I'm better in a team setting. I don't like letting my friends down. I'm better at letting myself down. I co-own a space in Williamsburg called Café Bureau. I'm having a show there on February 28th, 2025. I think it's gonna be from 6pm til whenever people leave so probably 11:30-ish. There will be a keg of Coors Light © but we also have other beer and wine. The address is 251 Grand st. I want to shock but not in a way that would be damaging. Thank you so much. <br/><br/>-Jake</p>",
