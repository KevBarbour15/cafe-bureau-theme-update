Instead, we‚Äôre giving you: üç∑ A drink on us‚Äîros√©, red, white, or a cold canned beer üé® All the supplies to bring your artistic fantasies to life üíÉ Two gorgeous lingerie-clad models to keep the energy high and the sketches steamy üñå A one-hour drawing session led by Jacob, your fine art teacher for the night This isn‚Äôt your typical drink-and-draw‚Äîit‚Äôs a night where creativity meets chemistry. We‚Äôve got games to break the ice, and if you're feeling friendly, stick around for pool or a Williamsburg bar hop after hours. Leave with a new friend, a new crush, or at the very least, a new number in your phone. Come single, bring your lover, or bring your newest Hinge match, but come ready to mingle!</p>"

I fell in love with tan lines at a young age. I used to fight a lot. It's hard to walk away from ding dongs. I like beer a lot but sometimes I'm not good at them. I'm really good at cigarettes. I smoked 3 cigarettes during the New York Marathon. I have bad ADHD. I might have CTE but I won't know until I take a dirt nap in a mahogany pea coat. I've never shown my paintings by myself. I'm better in a team setting. I don't like letting my friends down. I'm better at letting myself down. I co-own a space in Williamsburg called Caf√© Bureau. I'm having a show there on February 28th, 2025. I think it's gonna be from 6pm til whenever people leave so probably 11:30-ish. There will be a keg of Coors Light ¬© but we also have other beer and wine. The address is 251 Grand st. I want to shock but not in a way that would be damaging. Thank you so much. <br/><br/>-Jake</p>",
